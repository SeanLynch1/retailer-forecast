## Customer & Marketing Data Analysis for Men's Fashion Retailer


This project focuses on analyzing customer demographics and forecasting channel performance for a men's fashion retailer, using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary objectives of the analysis are:

- Demographic Insights: Analyzing age and gender data to identify any significant trends or correlations. The analysis found limited correlation with gender but provided more insights on age demographics.
  
- Channel Performance Forecasting: Leveraging historical marketing and sales data to predict which marketing channels are likely to perform best in the future. This analysis is used to guide the retailer in optimizing its marketing efforts and resource allocation.


All data analysis, including code, visualizations, and forecasting models, is documented within the Jupyter Notebook included in this repository.
